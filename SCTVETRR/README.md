# SCTVETRR (SCTVET Result Raptor)
#### By Amrut Kumar Meher

## Project Overview
SCTVET Result Raptor (SCTVETRR) is a robust program designed to efficiently retrieve results from the SCTVET website, especially during peak times when the server is prone to overload due to high traffic. This ensures that users can access their results without delay, even if the server is temporarily down.

## Features
- **Normal Fetching Mode**: Used under normal server conditions for standard result retrieval.
- **Force Retriever Mode**: Activated when the server is down due to traffic spikes, such as immediately after result announcements.

## Contribution
This project is developed and maintained by Amrut Kumar Meher, a student of Govt. Polytechnic Bargarh, CSE batch 2023-26. The primary aim is to facilitate uninterrupted access to examination results, thereby reducing the inconvenience caused by server downtimes.
